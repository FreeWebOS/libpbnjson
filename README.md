libpbnjson
==========

Summary
-------
Palm's Better Native JSON library

Description
-----------
A JSON engine, implemented as a pair of libraries with APIs for easier C and
C++ abstraction over the core PBNJSON library.

Dependencies
============

Below are the tools and libraries (and their minimum versions) required to build _libpbnjson_:

- boost-program-options 1.48
- cmake (version required by cmake-modules-webos)
- gcc 4.6.3 or clang
- g++ 4.6.3 or clang
- glib 2.30.0
- gmp 5.0.2
- gperf 3.0.3
- lemon 3.7.9
- make (any version)
- freewebos/cmake-modules-webos 1.0b
- freewbos/PmLogLib-headers 3.0.0 (only headers from PmLogLib)
- pkg-config 0.26
- uriparser 0.7.5
- yajl 1.0.12 or 2.0.4
- bash

Below is the component (and its minimum version) required to use key-value logging:

- freewebos/PmLogLib 3.0.0


How to Build on Linux or FreeBSD
================================

## Building

Once you have downloaded the source, enter the following to build it (after
changing into the directory under which it was downloaded):

    $ mkdir BUILD
    $ cd BUILD
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The directory under which the files are installed defaults to `/usr/local/webos`.
You can install them elsewhere by supplying a value for `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`
when invoking `cmake`. For example:

    $ cmake -D WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT:PATH=$HOME/projects/openwebos ..
    $ make
    $ make install

will install the files in subdirectories of `$HOME/projects/openwebos`.

Specifying `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` also causes `pkg-config` to look in that tree
first before searching the standard locations. You can specify additional
directories to be searched prior to this one by setting the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`
environment variable.

If not specified, `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` defaults to `/usr/local/webos`.

To configure for a debug build, enter:

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..

To see a list of the make targets that `cmake` has generated, enter:

    $ make help

Please note, to build library, you need to have PmLogLib headers. To
install them, use corresponding cmake flags for PmlogLib.

## Uninstalling

From the directory where you originally ran `make install`, enter:

    $ [sudo] make uninstall

You will need to use `sudo` if you did not specify `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`.

## Generating Documentation

The tools required to generate the documentation are:

- doxygen 1.7.6.1
- graphviz 2.26.3

To generate the documentation, add `-D WITH_DOCS:BOOL=TRUE` to the `cmake`
command line and make the `docs` target:

    $ cmake -D WITH_DOCS:BOOL=TRUE <other-args> ..
    $ make docs

To view the generated HTML documentation, point your browser to
`Documentation/pbnjson/html/*/index.html`

## Logging

To enable key-value logging with PmLogLib, user application can be linked
with PmLogLib library.

## TODO
+ Warnings: generates a lot of C11 warnings with Clang
